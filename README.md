# Shai's React Sandbox
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a small, pointless webapp designed by Shai to help him learn the react, javascript, typescript, html, and css languages and frameworks for his Oracle internship Summer 2022.

It is currently deployed on AWS here: https://main.d3mzah00m0wzgw.amplifyapp.com/
