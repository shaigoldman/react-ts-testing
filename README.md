# Shai's React Sandbox
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is a small, pointless webapp designed by Shai to help him learn the react, javascript, typescript, html, and css languages and frameworks.

It is currently deployed on AWS here: https://main.d3mzah00m0wzgw.amplifyapp.com/
